# MD380 Vocoder library

This library uses the md380 firmware to encode and decode AMBE+2 2450x1150 voice.  See the header file for usage. This is based on the emulator in the md380tools project, and can only be run on an ARM platform like a Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4.  This will not work on a Pi Zero or Pi 1.
